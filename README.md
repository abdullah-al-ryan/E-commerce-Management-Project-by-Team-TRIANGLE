# E-commerce-Management-Project-by-Team-TRIANGLE
E-commerce Management is a popular Business model in this modern era. It's a profitable business as well. That's why we "Team TRIANGLE" choose this topic for our final project of 'Software Project 3' course. We used "Java Programming Language" for this project. For coding we used 'NetBeans' IDE.
For database services we used "MySQL".
